# multineuralnetwork
This is a multi neural network that is coded in MATLAB.
The back propogation was done alongside with the use of a sigmoid function.
Rather than using the built in libraries that MATLAB has, this file was done and created to be able to understand the concepts of MNN and try to tweak it to the best of my abilities. The dataset used was an open source data set from UCI.
